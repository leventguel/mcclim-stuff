@defvr {Package} {drei-editing}
Functions and facilities for changing the
buffer contents by syntactical elements. The functions in this
package are syntax-aware, and their behavior is based on the
semantics defined by the syntax of the buffer, that the mark they
are manipulating belong to. These functions are also directly
used to implement the editing commands.
