@findex drei-core:fill-line
Breaks the contents of line pointed to by @code{mark} up to @code{mark} into
multiple lines such that none of them is longer than @code{fill-column}. If
COMPRESS-WHITESPACES is non-nil, whitespaces are compressed after the
decision is made to break the line at a point. For now, the
compression means just the deletion of trailing whitespaces.
