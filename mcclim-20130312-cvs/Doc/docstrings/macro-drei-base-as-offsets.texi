@findex drei-base:as-offsets
Bind the symbols in @code{marks} to the numeric offsets of the mark
objects that the symbols are bound to. If a symbol in @code{mark} is
already bound to an offset, just keep that binding. An element of
@code{marks} may also be a list @code{-} in this case, the second element is
used to get an offset, and the first element (which should be a
symbol) will be bound to this offset. Evaluate @code{body} with these
bindings.
