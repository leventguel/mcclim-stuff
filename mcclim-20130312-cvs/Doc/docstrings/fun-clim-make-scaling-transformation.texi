@findex clim:make-scaling-transformation
MAKE-SCALING-TRANSFORMATION returns a transformation that multiplies 
the x-coordinate distance of every point from origin by SCALE-X and the 
y-coordinate distance of every point from origin by SCALE-Y.  SCALE-X and 
SCALE-Y must be real numbers.  If ORIGIN is supplied it must be a point; 
if not supplied it defaults to (0, 0).  ORIGIN-X and ORIGIN-Y must be 
real numbers, and default to 0.
