@findex clim:read-bitmap-file
Read a bitmap file named by @code{pathname}. @code{port} specifies the
port that the bitmap is to be used on. Format is a keyword
symbol naming any defined bitmap file format defined by
clim-extensions:define-bitmap-file-reader. Two values are
returned: a two-dimensional array of pixel values and an array of
either colors or color names. If the second value is non-NIL, the
pixel values are assumed to be indexes into this
array. Otherwise, the pixel values are taken to be RGB values
encoded in 32 bit unsigned integers, with the three most
significant octets being the values R, G and B, in order.
