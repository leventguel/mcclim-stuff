@deffn {Generic Function} {clim:stream-advance-to-column} stream column
@findex clim:stream-advance-to-column
Write enough blank space so that the next character will be
  written at the specified column. Returns true if the operation is
  successful, or NIL if it is not supported for this stream. This is
  intended for use by by PPRINT and FORMAT ~@code{t}. The default method uses
  @code{stream-line-column} and repeated calls to @code{stream-write-char} with a
  #SPACE character; it returns NIL if @code{stream-line-column} returns NIL.
