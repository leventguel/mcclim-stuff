Let the user drag a line on stream, returning the
coordinates of the line ends as four values. @code{pointer} is the
pointer that will be tracked (the default should be used unless
the port has multiple pointing devices), multiple-window is
currently unimplemented and start-x/start-y, if provided (and
both or none must be provided) are the coordinates for one end of
the line. If these arguments are not provided, the user will have
to press a mouse button to specify the beginning of the line. If
finish-on-release is true, the function will end when the user
releases the mouse button. If false, the user will have to click
to finish inputting the line.
