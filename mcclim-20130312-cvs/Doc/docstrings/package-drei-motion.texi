@defvr {Package} {drei-motion}
Functions and facilities for moving a mark
around by syntactical elements. The functions in this package are
syntax-aware, and their behavior is based on the semantics
defined by the syntax of the buffer, that the mark they are
manipulating belong to. These functions are also directly used to
implement the motion commands.
