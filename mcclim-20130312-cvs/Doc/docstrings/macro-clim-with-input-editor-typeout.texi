@findex clim:with-input-editor-typeout
Clear space above the input-editing stream stream and
evaluate body, capturing output done to stream. Place will be
obtained above the input-editing area and the output put
there. Nothing will be displayed until body finishes. Stream
is not evaluated and must be a symbol. If @code{t} (the default),
*standard-input* will be used. Stream will be bound to an
@code{extended-output-stream} while body is being evaluated.
