@anchor{Function clim:write-token}
@deffn {Function} {clim:write-token} token stream &key acceptably
@findex clim:write-token
This function is the opposite of @code{read-token} given the string
token, it writes it to the interactive stream stream. If
acceptably is true and there are any characters in the token
that are delimiter gestures (see the macro
@code{with-delimiter-gestures}), then @code{write-token} will surround the
token with quotation marks (#").

Typically, @code{present} methods will use @code{write-token} instead of
write-string.
