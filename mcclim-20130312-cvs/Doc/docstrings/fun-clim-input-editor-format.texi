@deffn {Generic Function} {clim:input-editor-format} stream format-string &rest args
@findex clim:input-editor-format
This function is like format, except that it
is intended to be called on input editing streams. It arranges to
insert "noise strings" in the input editor's input
buffer. Programmers can use this to display in-line prompts in
@code{accept} methods.

If stream is a stream that is not an input editing stream, then
@code{input-editor-format} is equivalent to format.
