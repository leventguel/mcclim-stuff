@findex clim:replace-input
Replaces the part of the input editing stream
streams input buffer that extends from buffer-start to its
scan pointer with the string new-input. buffer-start defaults
to the current input position of stream, which is the position at
which the current accept "session" starts. start and end can be
supplied to specify a subsequence of new-input; start defaults to
0 and end defaults to the length of new-input.

@code{replace-input} will queue a rescan by calling @code{queue-rescan} if
the new input does not match the old input, or rescan is
true. If rescan is explicitly provided as NIL, no rescan will
be queued in any case.

The returned value is the position in the input buffer.
