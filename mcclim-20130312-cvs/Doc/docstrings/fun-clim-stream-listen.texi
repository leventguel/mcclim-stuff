@findex clim:stream-listen
This is used by LISTEN. It returns true or false. The default method uses
  @code{stream-read-char-no-hang} and @code{stream-unread-char}. Most streams should
  define their own method since it will usually be trivial and will
  always be more efficient than the default method.
