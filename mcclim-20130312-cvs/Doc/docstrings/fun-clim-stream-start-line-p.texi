Is STREAM known to be positioned at the beginning of a line?
  It is permissible for an implementation to always return
  NIL. This is used in the implementation of FRESH-LINE. Note that
  while a value of 0 from @code{stream-line-column} also indicates the
  beginning of a line, there are cases where @code{stream-start-line-p} can be
  meaningfully implemented although @code{stream-line-column} can't be. For
  example, for a window using variable-width characters, the column
  number isn't very meaningful, but the beginning of the line does have
  a clear meaning. The default method for @code{stream-start-line-p} on class
  @code{fundamental-character-output-stream} uses @code{stream-line-column}, so if
  that is defined to return NIL, then a method should be provided for
  either @code{stream-start-line-p} or @code{stream-fresh-line}.
