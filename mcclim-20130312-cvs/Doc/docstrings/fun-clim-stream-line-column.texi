@findex clim:stream-line-column
Return the column number where the next character
  will be written, or NIL if that is not meaningful for this stream.
  The first column on a line is numbered 0. This function is used in
  the implementation of PPRINT and the FORMAT ~@code{t} directive. For every
  character output stream class that is defined, a method must be
  defined for this function, although it is permissible for it to
  always return NIL.
