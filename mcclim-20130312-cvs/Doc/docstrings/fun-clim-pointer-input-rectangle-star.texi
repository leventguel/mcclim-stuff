@findex clim:pointer-input-rectangle*
Let the user drag a rectangle on stream and return four
values, the coordinates of the rectangle. @code{pointer} is the
pointer that will be tracked (the default should be used unless
the port has multiple pointing devices), multiple-window is
currently unimplemented and both left/top and
right/bottom specify an initial position for a rectangle
corner. You must provide either both parts of any of these two
coordinate pairs or none at all. If you provide both left/top
and right/bottom, the left/top values will be used,
otherwise, the non-nil set will be used. If neither is specified,
the user will be able to specify the origin corner of the
rectangle by clicking the mouse. If finish-on-release is true,
the function will end when the user releases the mouse button. If
false, the user will have to click to finish inputting the
rectangle.
