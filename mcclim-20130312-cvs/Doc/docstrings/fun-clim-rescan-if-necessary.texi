@deffn {Generic Function} {clim:rescan-if-necessary} stream &optional inhibit-activation
@findex clim:rescan-if-necessary
Invokes a rescan operation on the input
editing stream stream if @code{queue-rescan} was called on the same
stream and no intervening rescan operation has taken
place. Resets the state of the "rescan queued" flag to false.

If inhibit-activation is false, the input line will not be
activated even if there is an activation character in it.
