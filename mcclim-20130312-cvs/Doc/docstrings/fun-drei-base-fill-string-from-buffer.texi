Copy from @code{offset1} to @code{offset2} in @code{buffer} to @code{string},
which must be an adjustable vector of characters with a fill
pointer. Once the buffer region has been copied to @code{string}, or a
non-character object has been encountered in the buffer, the
number of characters copied to @code{string} will be returned.
