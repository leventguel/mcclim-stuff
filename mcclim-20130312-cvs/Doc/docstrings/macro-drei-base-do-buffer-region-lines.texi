Iterate over the lines in the region delimited by @code{mark1} and @code{mark2}.
   For each line, @code{line-var} will be bound to a mark positioned
   at the beginning of the line and @code{body} will be executed. Note
   that the iteration will always start from the mark specifying
   the earliest position in the buffer.
