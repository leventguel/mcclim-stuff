@anchor{Variable esa:*esa-instance*}
@defvr {Variable} {esa:*esa-instance*}
@vindex esa:*esa-instance*
This symbol should be bound to an @code{esa} instance, though any
object will do, provided the proper methods are defined. It will
be used as the argument to the various "query" functions
defined by @code{esa}. For the vast majority of ESAs, @code{*esa-instance*}
will probably have the same value as @code{*application-frame*}.
