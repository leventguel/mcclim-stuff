@deffn {Macro} {clim:completing-from-suggestions} (stream &rest args) &body body
@findex clim:completing-from-suggestions
Reads input from the input editing stream stream, completing
over a set of possibilities generated by calls to @code{suggest}
within body. Body may have zero or more declarations as its
first forms.

@code{completing-from-suggestions} returns three values, object,
success, and @code{string}.

The stream argument is not evaluated, and must be a symbol that
is bound to a stream. If stream t is (the default),
*standard-input* is used. Partial-completers,
allow-any-input, and possibility-printer are as for
@code{complete-input}.

Implementations will probably use @code{complete-from-generator} to
implement this.
