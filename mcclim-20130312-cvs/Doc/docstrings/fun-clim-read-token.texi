@findex clim:read-token
Reads characters from the interactive stream stream until it
encounters a delimiter or activation gesture, or a pointer
gesture. Returns the accumulated string that was delimited by the
delimiter or activation gesture, leaving the delimiter
unread.

If the first character of typed input is a quotation mark (#"),
then @code{read-token} will ignore delimiter gestures until another
quotation mark is seen. When the closing quotation mark is seen,
@code{read-token} will proceed as above.

Click-only is ignored for now.

Input-wait-handler and pointer-button-press-handler are as
for 34stream-read-gesture
