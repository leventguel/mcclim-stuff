@deffn {Generic Function} {esa:command-for-unbound-gestures} thing gestures
@findex esa:command-for-unbound-gestures
Called when @code{gestures} is input by the user
and there is no associated command in the current command
table. The function should return either a (possibly incomplete)
command or NIL. In the latter case (which is handled by a default
method), the gestures will be treated as actual unbound
gestures. @code{thing} is something that might be interested in
commands, at the beginning usually a command processor, but it
can call the function for other objects it knows in order to get
their opinion. @code{gestures} is a list of gestures.
