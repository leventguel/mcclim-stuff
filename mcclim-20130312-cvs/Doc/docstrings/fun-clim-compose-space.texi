During the space composition pass, a composite pane will 
typically ask each of its children how much space it requires by calling @code{compose-space}. 
They answer by returning space-requirement objects. The composite will then form 
its own space requirement by composing the space requirements of its children 
according to its own rules for laying out its children.

Returns a @code{space-requirement} object.
