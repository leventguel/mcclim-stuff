@deffn {Macro} {clim:with-activation-gestures} (gestures &key override) &body body
@findex clim:with-activation-gestures
Specifies a list of gestures that terminate input during the
execution of body. Body may have zero or more declarations as
its first forms. Gestures must be either a single gesture name
or a form that evaluates to a list of gesture names.

If the boolean override is true, then gestures will override
the current activation gestures. If it is false (the default),
then gestures will be added to the existing set of activation
gestures. @code{with-activation-gestures} must bind
@code{*activation-gestures*} to the new set of activation gestures.

See also the :activation-gestures and
:additional-activation-gestures options to @code{accept}.
