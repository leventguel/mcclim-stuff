@deffn {Macro} {drei-core:with-narrowed-buffer} (drei low-limit high-limit &optional soft) &body body
@findex drei-core:with-narrowed-buffer
Evluate @code{body} with the point and mark of @code{drei} narrowed to
the region delimited by @code{low-mark} and @code{high-mark}, which may
either be a left-sticky-mark and right-sticky mark (respectively)
or two integer offsets. @code{low-mark} and @code{high-mark} may also be T
or NIL, meaning "beginning/end of buffer" (as appropriate) and
"current position of point", respectively. If @code{soft} is true,
point and mark will be moved to be within the narrowed buffer,
otherwise, this situation is an error.
