@deffn {Macro} {clim:with-delimiter-gestures} (gestures &key override) &body body
@findex clim:with-delimiter-gestures
Specifies a list of gestures that terminate an individual
token, but not the entire input, during the execution of
body. Body may have zero or more declarations as its first
forms. Gestures must be either a single gesture name or a form
that evaluates to a list of gesture names.

If the boolean override is true, then gestures will override
the current delimiter gestures. If it is false (the default),
then gestures will be added to the existing set of delimiter
gestures. @code{with-delimiter-gestures} must bind
@code{*delimiter-gestures*} to the new set of delimiter
gestures.

See also the :delimiter-gestures and
:additional-delimiter-gestures options to @code{accept}.
