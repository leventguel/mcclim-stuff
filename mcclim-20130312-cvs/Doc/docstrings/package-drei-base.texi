@defvr {Package} {drei-base}
Basic functionality built on top of the buffer
protocol. Here is where we define slightly higher level
functions, that can be directly implemented in terms of the
buffer protocol, but that are not, strictly speaking, part of
that protocol. The functions in this package are not
syntax-aware, and are thus limited in what they can do. They
percieve the buffer as little more than a sequence of
characters.
