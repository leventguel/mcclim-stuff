@deffn {Macro} {clim-extensions:merging-dead-keys} (gesture state) &body body
@findex clim-extensions:merging-dead-keys
Accumulate dead keys and subsequent characters. Gesture
should be a symbol bound to either a gesture or an input
event. Body will be evaluated either with the gesture binding
unchanged, or with gesture bound to the result of merging
preceding dead keys. State must be a place, initially NIL, that
will contain the state of dead-key handling, enabling
asynchronous use of the macro.
