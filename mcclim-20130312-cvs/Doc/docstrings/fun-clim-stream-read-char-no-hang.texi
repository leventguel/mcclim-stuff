This is used to implement READ-CHAR-NO-HANG. It returns either a
  character, or NIL if no input is currently available, or :EOF if
  end-of-file is reached. The default method provided by
  @code{fundamental-character-input-stream} simply calls @code{stream-read-char}; this
  is sufficient for file streams, but interactive streams should define
  their own method.
